*   Run `python setup.py install` (admin privileges may be required)

### Dependencies

Package dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

The below rule should be applied in general when trying to use a utility class,

> from utilbox.*<package_name>* import *<class_name>*

For example to use the `FileUtils` class from `os_utils` package,

> from utilbox.*os_utils* import *FileUtils*

Here are some real-world scenarios where `utilbox` can serve your purposes,

### Example 1
Let's say you want to fetch only the last line of some text file. To do this,

```python
from utilbox.os_utils import FileUtils

last_line = FileUtils.get_file_last_line("path/to/file.ext")
print last_line
```

### Example 2
What if you wanted the epoch time? No worries,

```python
from utilbox.os_utils import SysUtils

epoch_time = SysUtils.get_epoch_time()
print epoch_time
```

### Example 3
You can send an email just as easily,

```python
from utilbox.mail_utils import MailUtils

smtp_server = "192.168.0.1"
sender_email_id = "someguy@example.com"

mailer = MailUtils(smtp_server, sender_email_id)

# send a plain-text message
mailer.send_mail_plain("receiver@example2.com", "This is a test mail", sender_email_id, "This message was brought to you by 'utilbox'!")

# send an HTML message
mailer.send_mail_plain("receiver@example2.com", "This is a test mail", sender_email_id, "This message was brought to you by <b>'utilbox'<b>!")
```
